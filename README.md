### Kia Ora 👋

I am a *Geospatial Data Scientist*
launching my career in the US 🚀 and seeing where it will take me.
My background is in Geography, with a particular interest in Earth Observation using satellites 🛰️,
having done cool research on Antarctic ice dynamics
during my [PhD](https://github.com/weiji14/phdthesis) in Aotearoa/New Zealand 🥝.
Specifically, I work on applying Deep Learning methods to Remote Sensing datasets,
keeping busy on the leading edge of [data-driven research in the Earth Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03356).

These are some of the hats I wear:

- 🎓 Postdoc at the [Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center](https://byrd.osu.edu)!
- 🌏 Core Developer of [PyGMT: A Pythonic Interface to the Generic Mapping Tools](https://www.pygmt.org)

I'm currently:

- 📈 Levelling up my [Machine Learning Engineering (MLOps)](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops) skills in a team environment
- 🔭 Making open source contributions to the [Pytorch ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem) and [Pangeo community](https://pangeo.io), all in the [PyData world](https://pydata.org)!

  - [DeepBedMap](https://github.com/weiji14/deepbedmap) - Super Resolution **Generative Adversarial Network** to resolve the bed topography of Antarctica
  - [DeepIceDrain](https://github.com/weiji14/deepicedrain) - Finding subglacial lakes using unsupervised **DBSCAN** clustering
  - [Crevasse detection and navigation](https://github.com/weiji14/nz_space_challenge) - Done using **Image Segmentation** + **Reinforcement Learning**

⚡ Fun fact: I was brought up **trilingual**, and am fluent in
**English, 中文 & Bahasa Melayu**.
