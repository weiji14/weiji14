### Kia Ora 👋

I am a *Geospatial Data Scientist*
from 🇲🇾 working remotely and pondering about where to go next!
My background is in Geography, with a particular interest in Earth Observation using satellites 🛰️,
having done cool research on Antarctic ice dynamics
during my [PhD](https://github.com/weiji14/phdthesis) in Aotearoa/New Zealand 🥝.
Nowadays, I'm striving to [boost](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-020924-124753)
the next generation of scientists towards better open science practices, crafting
[composable pipelines and designing for accelerated hardware systems](https://voltrondata.com/codex)
that will take us to the next frontier 🚀

These are some of the hats I wear:
- ☁️ Machine Learning Engineer in the GeoAI team at [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org)
- 🌏 Core Developer of [PyGMT: A Pythonic Interface to the Generic Mapping Tools](https://www.pygmt.org)
- ⚒️ Maintainer of recipes on [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org) and other packaging efforts

I'm currently:
- ⚙️ Developing a Rust/PyO3 library called [cog3pio](https://github.com/weiji14/cog3pio), with an outlook on GPU-accelerated access to Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs.
- 🌱 Making open source contributions to [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io), [GeoRust](https://github.com/georust) and other adjacent ecosystems!

  - [Crevasse detection and navigation](https://github.com/weiji14/nz_space_challenge) - Done using **Image Segmentation** + **Reinforcement Learning**
  - [S2S2Net](https://github.com/weiji14/s2s2net) - Sentinel-2 Super-Resolution Segmentation Network using a **Vision Transformer** model (SegFormer)

⚡ Fun fact: I was brought up **trilingual**, and am fluent in
**English, 中文 & Bahasa Melayu**.
