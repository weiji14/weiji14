### Kia Ora 👋

I am a *Geospatial Data Scientist*
from Malaysia 🇲🇾 working remotely and thinking about where to go next!
My background is in Geography, with a particular interest in Earth Observation using satellites 🛰️,
having done cool research on Antarctic ice dynamics
during my [PhD](https://github.com/weiji14/phdthesis) in Aotearoa/New Zealand 🥝.
Specifically, I work on applying Deep Learning methods to Remote Sensing datasets,
keeping busy on the leading edge of [data-driven research in the Earth Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03356).

These are some of the hats I wear:
- ☁️ Machine Learning Engineer in the GeoAI team at [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org)
- 🌏 Core Developer of [PyGMT: A Pythonic Interface to the Generic Mapping Tools](https://www.pygmt.org)

I'm currently:
- 🦀 Learning Rust, and trying to get into the [GeoRust](https://github.com/georust) ecosystem
- ☯️ Developing a Python package called [zen3geo](https://zen3geo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walkthrough.html) for building Earth Observation and geospatial data pipelines
- 🔭 Making open source contributions to the [Pytorch ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem) and [Pangeo community](https://pangeo.io), all in the [PyData world](https://pydata.org)!
