### Kia Ora 👋

I am a *Geospatial Data Scientist*
at the [Antarctic Research Centre](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/antarctic) in New Zealand.
My research focuses on the Antarctic ice sheet's dynamics,
i.e. how fast can the ice flow, and how much sea level rise we should expect and plan for.
Specifically, I work on [mapping subglacial water in Antarctica](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/antarctic/study/profiles/wei-ji-leong)
using Machine Learning methods on Earth Observation satellite datasets,
keeping busy on the leading edge of [data-driven research in the Earth Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03356).

These are some of the hats I wear:

- 🎓 PhD Student in Glaciology at [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz)
- 🌏 Core Developer of [PyGMT: A Pythonic Interface to the Generic Mapping Tools](https://www.pygmt.org)

I'm currently:

- 👯 Looking to collaborate on [DeepIceDrain](https://github.com/weiji14/deepicedrain) - Mapping deep subglacial water activity in Antarctica
- 🔭 Working on contributing to [PyData](https://pydata.org) and [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) community projects like [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) and [IcePyx](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx).

Want to reach out?

- 💬 Ask me about [DeepBedMap](https://github.com/weiji14/deepbedmap) - A super resolution deep neural network for resolving the bed of Antarctica
- 📫 Track me on Github as [@weiji14](https://github.com/weiji14), or find some other links on my [Website](https://weiji14.github.io) (Work in Progress)!

⚡ Fun fact: I was brought up **trilingual**, and am fluent in
**English, 中文 & Bahasa Melayu**.
