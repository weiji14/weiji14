### Kia Ora 👋

I am a *Geospatial Data Scientist*
launching my career in the US 🚀 and seeing where it will take me.
My background is in Geography, with a particular interest in Earth Observation using satellites 🛰️,
having done cool research on Antarctic ice dynamics
during my [PhD](https://github.com/weiji14/phdthesis) in Aotearoa/New Zealand 🥝.
Specifically, I work on applying Deep Learning methods to Remote Sensing datasets,
keeping busy on the leading edge of [data-driven research in the Earth Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03356).

These are some of the hats I wear:

- 🧑‍🔬 Researcher at the [Frontier Development Lab (FDL) 2022 program](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/fdl2022)!
- 🎓 Postdoc at the [Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center](https://byrd.osu.edu)
- 🌏 Core Developer of [PyGMT: A Pythonic Interface to the Generic Mapping Tools](https://www.pygmt.org)

I'm currently:

- 🌳 Immersed in research with a fantastic multi-disciplinary team on Self-supervised learning on SAR data for change detection, for the [FDL2022 NASA Earth Science challenge](https://en.calameo.com/read/005503280b48b2c20f5c2)!
- ☯️ Starting a new Python package called [zen3geo](https://zen3geo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walkthrough.html) for Earth Observation and geospatial data ingestion
- 🔭 Making open source contributions to the [Pytorch ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem) and [Pangeo community](https://pangeo.io), all in the [PyData world](https://pydata.org)!

  - [DeepBedMap](https://github.com/weiji14/deepbedmap) - Super Resolution **Generative Adversarial Network** to resolve the bed topography of Antarctica
  - [DeepIceDrain](https://github.com/weiji14/deepicedrain) - Finding subglacial lakes using unsupervised **DBSCAN** clustering
  - [Crevasse detection and navigation](https://github.com/weiji14/nz_space_challenge) - Done using **Image Segmentation** + **Reinforcement Learning**

⚡ Fun fact: I was brought up **trilingual**, and am fluent in
**English, 中文 & Bahasa Melayu**.
