### Kia Ora 👋

I am a *Geospatial Data Scientist*
based in Aotearoa/New Zealand 🥝 currently in between a PhD and a Postdoc.
My [research](https://github.com/weiji14/phdthesis) focuses on the Antarctic ice sheet's dynamics,
i.e. how fast can the ice flow, and how much sea level rise we should expect and plan for.
Specifically, I work on [mapping subglacial water in Antarctica](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/antarctic/study/profiles/wei-ji-leong)
using Machine Learning methods on Earth Observation satellite datasets,
keeping busy on the leading edge of [data-driven research in the Earth Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03356).

These are some of the hats I wear:

- 🎓 PhD in Glaciology at the [Antarctic Research Centre](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/antarctic) (just graduated)!
- 🌏 Core Developer of [PyGMT: A Pythonic Interface to the Generic Mapping Tools](https://www.pygmt.org)

I'm currently:

- 🧑‍🎓 Training myself on [Machine Learning Engineering (MLOps)](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops) techniques
- 🔭 Making open source contributions to the [Pytorch ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem) and [Pangeo community](https://pangeo.io), all in the [PyData world](https://pydata.org)!
